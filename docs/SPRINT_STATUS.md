## ⚡ BEFORE Starting Work

**🚨 CHECK [`docs/MODULE_REGISTRY.md`](MODULE_REGISTRY.md) FIRST - Eliminates 200k+ token Explore waste!**

Find your modules instantly instead of running Explore agents for 15 minutes.

**Token savings:**
- ❌ Running Explore agents: 200k+ tokens, ~15 minutes
- ✅ Checking MODULE_REGISTRY: 5k tokens, ~30 seconds
- **Savings: ~195k tokens per sprint**

**What's in the registry:** All 25+ features, 83 hooks, 60 component directories, 36 dashboard routes

**DO NOT run Explore agents without checking the registry first!**

## ✅ Sprint 97 - Docker Build, Cloud Run Deploy & Smoke Test - COMPLETE

**Priority:** P0 - CRITICAL
**Completed:** 2026-02-06

**Goal:** Build amd64 Docker image via Cloud Build, deploy to Cloud Run, verify production app.

### Cloud Build Setup
- [x] **Secret Manager IAM fixed** — Cloud Build uses Compute Engine default SA (`424251610296-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`), granted `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor` at project + per-secret level for all 7 NEXT_PUBLIC_* secrets
- [x] **Cloud Build succeeded** — Build ID `4e6aff61-bb47-4c69-b3f4-f2a0ac44bc06`, all 4 steps passed (build, push SHA, push latest, deploy)
- [x] **Build time:** ~8.5 minutes (Next.js 16 Turbopack production build)

### Cloud Run Deployment
- [x] **Service:** `contractoros-alpha` in `us-west1`
- [x] **URL:** https://contractoros-alpha-cajchtshqa-uw.a.run.app
- [x] **Config:** 1Gi memory, 1 CPU, min 1 / max 10 instances, CPU boost enabled
- [x] **Image:** `us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/contractoros-483812/contractoros/contractoros-web:f3b8201`

### Smoke Tests
- [x] `/` → 200 (root/landing)
- [x] `/login` → 200 (login page, title: "ContractorOS")
- [x] `/register` → 200
- [x] `/onboarding` → 200
- [x] `/dashboard` → 307 redirect to login (auth working)
- [x] `/client` → 307 redirect (auth working)
- [x] `/sub` → 307 redirect (auth working)
- [x] `/field` → 307 redirect (auth working)
- [x] JS bundles loading correctly
- [x] Cloud Run conditions: Ready ✅, ConfigurationsReady ✅, RoutesReady ✅

### Key Learnings
- **Cloud Build SA**: `gcloud builds submit` uses Compute Engine default SA, NOT the Cloud Build SA — must grant secrets to `{PROJECT_NUMBER}-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`
- **Code must be committed**: Cloud Build uploads working directory but Docker build requires committed code to match
- **Cold start**: First request ~5.4s, subsequent ~150ms (min-instances=1 helps)

## ✅ Sprint 113 - Console Cleanup & Structured Logging - COMPLETE

**Priority:** P1
**Completed:** 2026-02-06

**Goal:** Replace ~1,100 raw console.* calls with structured logger utility; add no-console ESLint rule.

## ✅ Sprint 111 - Field Portal Hardening - COMPLETE

**Priority:** P1
**Completed:** 2026-02-06

**Goal:** Add 4 missing field worker capabilities — issue reporting, safety incidents, equipment checkout, material requests.

### New Files Created
- [x] `lib/hooks/useIssues.ts` — Real-time onSnapshot hook for `organizations/{orgId}/issues` collection, CRUD operations
- [x] `lib/hooks/useMaterialRequests.ts` — Real-time onSnapshot hook for `organizations/{orgId}/materialRequests` collection, CRUD operations
- [x] `app/field/issue/page.tsx` — Mobile-first issue reporting form + recent issues list (365 lines)
- [x] `app/field/safety/page.tsx` — Safety incident form with OSHA auto-detection + recent incidents (483 lines)
- [x] `app/field/equipment/page.tsx` — Equipment checkout/return with Available + My Checkouts tabs (446 lines)
- [x] `app/field/materials/page.tsx` — Material request form with dynamic item rows + request history (395 lines)

### Files Modified
- [x] `types/index.ts` — Added MaterialRequest, MaterialRequestItem, MaterialRequestStatus, MaterialRequestPriority types + label constants
- [x] `app/field/page.tsx` — Added 3 new quick action cards (Safety Report, Equipment, Request Materials) to home page grid

### Key Design Decisions
- **useIssues hook**: Org-scoped collection `organizations/{orgId}/issues`, onSnapshot real-time, limit(50)
- **useMaterialRequests hook**: Org-scoped collection `organizations/{orgId}/materialRequests`, onSnapshot real-time, limit(50)
- **Safety page**: Uses existing `useSafetyIncidents` hook from `useSafety.ts` — auto-checks OSHA reportable for medical/lost_time/fatality severity
- **Equipment page**: Uses existing `useEquipment` hook — two-tab layout (Available / My Checkouts) with checkout/return slide-up panels
- **Materials page**: Dynamic item rows (add/remove), 12 unit options, priority selector, filtered to current user's requests
- **Home page**: 6 quick action cards in 2-column grid (Photos, Issues, Safety, Equipment) + full-width Materials row

### TypeScript

## ✅ Sprint 110 - QuickBooks Online — Invoice & Expense Sync - COMPLETE

**Priority:** P1
**Completed:** 2026-02-06

**Goal:** Wire auto-sync for invoices/expenses, fix account resolution placeholders, replace fake triggerSync with real API call.

### New Files Created
- [x] `app/api/integrations/quickbooks/sync/invoice/route.ts` — POST endpoint: verifies auth, checks QBO connection + `autoSyncInvoices` setting, calls `syncInvoiceOnSend()`
- [x] `app/api/integrations/quickbooks/sync/expense/route.ts` — POST endpoint: verifies auth, checks QBO connection + `autoSyncExpenses` setting, calls `syncExpenseOnApproval()`

### Files Modified
- [x] `lib/hooks/useInvoices.ts` — Added fire-and-forget sync call in `sendInvoice()` after status update to 'sent'
- [x] `lib/hooks/useExpenses.ts` — Added fire-and-forget sync call in `approveExpense()` after approval
- [x] `lib/integrations/quickbooks/sync-expenses.ts` — Fixed `getExpenseAccountRef()`: queries QBO by name with caching, falls back to Expense-type account. Fixed `bankAccountRef`: loads from connection doc `defaultBankAccountId` or queries QBO for Bank-type account
- [x] `lib/hooks/useAccountingConnection.ts` — Replaced `setTimeout` fake sync with real API call to `/api/integrations/quickbooks/sync` with `{ action: 'full' }`, proper error handling
- [x] `components/settings/QBOAccountMapping.tsx` — Added `onSaveDefaults` + `defaultAccounts` props, save button for default income/expense/asset accounts

### Key Design Decisions
- **Fire-and-forget pattern**: Auto-sync calls are non-blocking — invoice send/expense approval never fails due to sync errors
- **API routes (not direct imports)**: Sync functions use `adminDb` (firebase-admin) which is server-only, so client hooks call API routes
- **QBO account caching**: Resolved accounts are cached in `accountingConnections/quickbooks.cachedAccounts` to avoid repeated QBO API calls
- **Settings-gated**: Auto-sync only fires when `autoSyncInvoices`/`autoSyncExpenses` is enabled in sync settings

### TypeScript
- `npx tsc --noEmit` → 0 errors ✅

## ✅ Sprint 109 - QuickBooks Online — OAuth & Account Mapping - COMPLETE

**Priority:** P1
**Completed:** 2026-02-06

## ✅ Sprint 64 - Firebase 12 Upgrade - COMPLETE

**Priority:** P2 - MEDIUM
**Completed:** 2026-02-05

**What Was Done:**
- ✅ Upgraded `firebase` JS SDK from 11.8.0 → 12.9.0
- ✅ Fixed named database bug in `lib/firebase/admin.ts` — was using `getFirestore(getApp())` (default DB), now correctly uses `getFirestore(getApp(), 'contractoros')`
- ✅ TypeScript check: 0 errors
- ✅ Production build: passes (152 static pages generated)
- ✅ No breaking changes apply (VertexAI not used, Node 22 already met, ES2020 already met, no Firebase enums used)

**Files Modified:**
- `package.json` — firebase 11.8.0 → 12.9.0
- `lib/firebase/admin.ts` — Added `'contractoros'` named database parameter

**Note:** `@firebase/auth` SSR warnings during static generation ("INTERNAL ASSERTION FAILED: Expected a class definition") are a known Firebase Auth SSR issue — Auth requires browser APIs. Does not affect runtime behavior.

## Session Handoff Notes

### For Next Session
1. **TypeScript is passing** — run `npx tsc --noEmit` to verify
2. **Sprint 96 COMPLETE** — Firebase deployed, 50 seeds executed, database populated
3. **Start Sprint 97** — Docker build + Cloud Run deploy + smoke test
4. **Sprint plan 97-105** in `docs/REPRIORITIZED_SPRINT_PLAN.md` (Phases 14-16)
5. **All major upgrades COMPLETE:** Node 22, Next.js 16, React 19, Firebase 12, ESLint 9, Tailwind 4, Zod 4
6. **ALWAYS deploy Firebase before Docker build** — see workflow below
7. **Demo data LIVE** — all 50 seeds executed against `contractoros` database
8. **1 non-blocking issue:** `syncGoogleReviewsManual` IAM policy — fix when real Google Business creds added
9. **After Docker deploy:** E2E regression (Sprint 98), portal verification (Sprint 99)

### Build & Deploy Workflow (CRITICAL)
```bash
# From apps/web/ directory - run these in order:
cd apps/web && npx tsc --noEmit && \
firebase deploy --only firestore --project contractoros-483812 && \
./docker-build-local.sh && \
docker stop contractoros-web 2>/dev/null; \
docker rm contractoros-web 2>/dev/null; \
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --name contractoros-web contractoros-web && \
docker ps
```
**Why:** Firebase indexes take 30s-2min to build. Deploy them BEFORE Docker build so they're ready when app starts.

### Known Issues
- Test coverage at ~8.5% statements (1,502 tests) — Sprint 101 targets 1,800+
- **Not yet deployed to production** — Docker build + Cloud Run deploy in Sprint 97
- 1,050 ESLint warnings — Sprint 100 targets <400
- `syncGoogleReviewsManual` IAM policy error — non-blocking, uses placeholder Google Business creds
- Google Business API integration needs real OAuth credentials (separate dev work)
