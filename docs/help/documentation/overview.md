## Legal Considerations

- Work completed
- Delays and causes
- Change requests
- Client decisions

### Documentation as Evidence

Your documentation may be used in:
- Contract disputes
- Insurance claims
- Lien proceedings
- Warranty claims
- Litigation

### Best Practices

- Date and timestamp everything
- Be factual, not emotional
- Don't delete (archive instead)
- Regular backups happen automatically

## Common Questions

### How long are photos kept?

Photos are kept indefinitely. Archived projects remain accessible.

### Can I delete a photo I uploaded?

You can remove photos if you have permission. They may be archived rather than permanently deleted.

### What's the maximum file size?

Images: 25MB per file
Documents: 100MB per file

### Can clients see all photos?

Only if you share them. By default, clients see what you explicitly share via the portal.

### How do I find a specific photo?

Use search with keywords from the caption, or filter by date, project, phase, or who took it.
