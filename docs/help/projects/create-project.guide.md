# Create a Project

This guide walks you through creating a new project from scratch. By the end, you'll have a project set up and ready for work.

---

## Before You Start

Have this information ready:
- Project name/description
- Site address
- Client name (or create new)
- Approximate start and end dates
- Project type

---

## Step-by-Step: Create a New Project

### Step 1: Open the New Project Form

**Option A**: From anywhere
- Click **+ New Project** in the left sidebar

**Option B**: From Projects page
- Go to **Projects**
- Click **+ New Project** button in top right

### Step 2: Enter Basic Information

| Field | Description | Required |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Project Name** | Clear, searchable name (e.g., "Smith - Kitchen Remodel") | Yes |
| **Project Type** | New Construction, Renovation, Remodel, etc. | Yes |
| **Status** | Lead, Estimate, Sold, Active | Yes |
| **Address** | Full site address | Yes |

**Tips**:
- Use a consistent naming convention across projects
- The address is used for mapping and weather forecasting

### Step 3: Add Client Information

**If client exists**:
1. Start typing client name in the search field
2. Select from dropdown
3. Their information auto-fills

**If new client**:
1. Click **+ Create New Client**
2. Enter client details:
   - Name (person or company)
   - Email
   - Phone
   - Billing address
3. Save—they're now linked to this project

### Step 4: Set Project Dates

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Start Date** | When work will begin on site |
| **End Date** | Target completion (can be adjusted later) |
| **Contract Date** | When contract was signed (optional) |

**Tips**:
- Start with your best estimate—dates are easily adjusted
- These dates drive the schedule view and forecasting

### Step 5: Add Project Details (Optional)

Expand the **Additional Details** section for:

| Field | Use Case |
|-------|----------|
| **Description** | Project summary, special notes |
| **Contract Value** | Total contract amount |
| **Square Footage** | For cost-per-SF calculations |
| **Permit Number** | Track permit status |
| **Superintendent** | Assign primary PM |
| **Tags** | Custom categorization |

### Step 6: Save the Project

Click **Create Project** to save.

You'll be taken to the new project's dashboard, ready to add phases, tasks, and more.

## What to Do Next

After creating a project, consider these next steps:

### Immediate (First Day)

1. **Add phases** - Break the project into major stages
   → [Working with phases](/help/projects/phases.guide.md)

2. **Upload documents** - Add contracts, plans, specs
   → [Managing documents](/help/projects/documents.guide.md)

3. **Assign team members** - Who's working this job?
   → [Project team](/help/projects/team.guide.md)

### First Week

4. **Create tasks** - Add initial to-dos and milestones
   → [Managing tasks](/help/projects/tasks.guide.md)

5. **Set up the schedule** - Build out the timeline
   → [Project scheduling](/help/scheduling/project-schedule.guide.md)

6. **Take baseline photos** - Document starting condition

## Alternative Ways to Create Projects

### From an Estimate

When you convert an estimate to a project:
1. Open the approved estimate
2. Click **Convert to Project**
3. Project is created with:
   - Client already linked
   - Contract value populated
   - Scope of work drafted

→ [Converting estimates to projects](/help/quotes-estimates/convert-to-project.guide.md)

### From a Template

If you do similar projects repeatedly:
1. Click **+ New Project**
2. Click **Use Template**
3. Select a template
4. Project is created with:
   - Pre-built phases
   - Standard tasks
   - Default documents

→ [Using project templates](/help/projects/templates.guide.md)

### Duplicate an Existing Project

Clone a similar completed project:
1. Open the source project
2. Click **⋮ → Duplicate Project**
3. Choose what to copy:
   - Phases and tasks
   - Documents
   - Team assignments
4. Update details for new project

## Common Questions

### Can I create a project without a client?

Yes, but not recommended. You can:
- Create a generic "Lead" client temporarily
- Add the real client later
- Create the client first, then the project

Projects without clients can't generate invoices or proposals.

### What if I don't know the end date?

Enter your best estimate. You can:
- Update it anytime
- Leave it blank (but schedules won't calculate)
- Use a placeholder like "TBD" in notes

### Can I delete a project?

Yes, but be careful:
- Projects with financial transactions can be **archived**, not deleted
- Archived projects are hidden but recoverable
- Deletion is permanent and removes all associated data

→ [Archiving and deleting projects](/help/projects/archive-delete.guide.md)

### How many projects can I have?

There's no limit. Performance stays fast even with thousands of projects. Use filters and search to navigate large project lists.

## Troubleshooting

### "Address not found" error

The address field uses Google Maps for validation:
- Check for typos
- Try a simpler format (just street and city)
- Include ZIP code
- For new construction, use the nearest existing address

### "Client already exists" warning

This appears when a similar client name is found:
- Click the match to use existing client
- If it's a different person with same name, click **Create Anyway**

### Form won't save

Check for:
- Required fields (marked with *)
- Valid date formats
- Internet connection
