## Client Experience Best Practices

### Set Expectations Early

During sales/onboarding:

- Show them what they'll see
- Encourage them to use it vs. calling

### Keep It Updated

The portal is only useful if it's current:
- Post photos regularly (at least weekly)
- Update progress accurately
- Respond to messages promptly

### Curate Content

Not everything needs to be shared:
- Quality over quantity for photos
- Summarize vs. overwhelm
- Highlight progress, don't just document problems

### Protect Privacy

Be mindful of:
- Other clients visible in photos
- Sensitive pricing details
- Team member personal info
