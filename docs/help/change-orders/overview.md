## Why Change Orders Matter

### Protect Your Business

Without proper change orders:
- Work done for free
- Disputes about scope
- Margin erosion
- Legal exposure

### Clear Communication

Change orders provide:
- Written record of changes
- Agreed-upon pricing
- Client acknowledgment
- Updated project scope

---

## Change Order Types

### Add Work

New scope added to project:
- Client requests additional work
- You discover necessary work
- Upgrades or enhancements

**Example:** Client wants to add a bathroom exhaust fan upgrade

### Delete Work

Scope removed from project:
- Client decides against something
- Item no longer needed
- Substitution that reduces scope

**Example:** Client opts out of second coat of paint in garage

### Change Work

Modification to existing scope:
- Different materials
- Different method
- Design revision

**Example:** Upgrade from laminate to quartz countertops

### Allowance Adjustment

Adjustment to allowance items:
- Over allowance (add cost)
- Under allowance (credit)

**Example:** Selected faucet exceeds $350 allowance by $200

## Pricing Changes

### Cost Components

Include all costs:
- Labor
- Materials
- Equipment
- Subcontractor
- Permits (if applicable)
- Overhead (if applicable)

### Markup

Apply your standard markup:
- Direct costs × markup rate
- Or use pre-defined rates
- Maintain consistency

### Credits

For delete orders:
- Credit the original amount
- Less any costs already incurred
- Net credit to client

### No Charge COs

Sometimes changes are at no cost:
- Warranty corrections
- Your error
- Goodwill gesture

Document these as $0 COs to maintain scope record.

## Best Practices

### Documentation

1. **Get it in writing** — Always create formal COs
2. **Be specific** — Detailed scope prevents disputes
3. **Include everything** — All costs, all impacts
4. **Reference original** — Tie to contract section

### Pricing

1. **Be fair** — Reasonable pricing builds trust
2. **Be consistent** — Same rates as original estimate
3. **Cover your costs** — Don't lose money on changes
4. **Include contingency** — For unknowns

### Process

1. **Act quickly** — Don't delay CO creation
2. **Get approval before work** — Except emergencies
3. **Communicate impact** — Schedule, cost, scope
4. **Track separately** — Monitor CO profitability

### Avoiding Scope Creep

| Warning Sign | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| "While you're here..." | Create CO immediately |
| Verbal requests | Get it in writing |
| Small additions | Even small changes add up |
| Design changes | Always a CO |

## Common Scenarios

### Client Requests Upgrade

1. Document the request
2. Price the upgrade
3. Credit original item
4. Net change = upgrade cost
5. Get approval
6. Proceed

### Hidden Condition Found

1. Stop work if significant
2. Document with photos
3. Create CO for additional work
4. Get approval before proceeding
5. Protect yourself

### Client Wants Credit for Deletion

1. Calculate original scope value
2. Deduct any costs already incurred
3. Net credit = what they get back
4. Document in CO
5. Get signature

### Emergency Change

1. Document immediately
2. Proceed if time-critical
3. Create CO ASAP
4. Get retroactive approval
5. Note emergency circumstances

## Common Questions

### Do I need a CO for small changes?

Yes. Small changes add up. Document everything to protect your margins.

### What if the client won't sign?

Don't proceed with the work until approved. If they insist on work without approval, document this clearly.

### Can I combine multiple changes?

Yes, for efficiency. But ensure each change is clearly documented.

### What if I underbid the original scope?

That's your responsibility. COs should only cover actual changes, not original estimating errors.

### How do I handle disputed COs?

Meet with the client to discuss. Be willing to negotiate. Document the resolution.
