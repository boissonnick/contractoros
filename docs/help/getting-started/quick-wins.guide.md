# Quick Wins: Get Value in Your First Week

Don't try to learn everything at once. Focus on these high-impact activities to see immediate value from ContractorOS.

---

## Day 1: Get Oriented

### Win #1: Create Your Active Projects
**Time: 15 minutes**

Get your current work into the system:

1. Go to **Projects → + New Project**
2. For each active job, create a project with:
   - Project name and address
   - Client name and contact
   - Approximate start/end dates
   - Current status

**Why this matters**: Once your projects exist, everything else connects to them—time entries, expenses, photos, documents.

> **Tip**: Don't worry about adding every detail now. You can fill in phases, budgets, and scope later.

### Win #2: Invite One Team Member
**Time: 5 minutes**

Start small. Invite your most tech-savvy team member first:

1. Go to **Settings → Team → Invite Member**
2. Enter their email
3. Select their role (PM for office, Employee for field)
4. Send the invitation

**Why this matters**: Having a second person validates that your setup works and gives you someone to bounce questions off.

---

## Day 2: Track Real Work

### Win #3: Log Time for Yesterday
**Time: 5 minutes**

Experience the time tracking workflow:

1. Go to **Time Tracking → + Add Entry**
2. Select one of your projects
3. Enter hours worked, description
4. Save

**Why this matters**: You'll understand what your team will experience. Time is money—accurate tracking is essential.

### Win #4: Take Project Photos
**Time: 5 minutes**

Document current progress:

1. Open one of your projects
2. Go to the **Photos** tab
3. Upload a few current site photos
4. Add captions describing what's shown

**Why this matters**: Photos become invaluable for disputes, change orders, and client updates. Start the habit now.

---

## Day 3: Client Communication

### Win #5: Add a Client Contact
**Time: 3 minutes**

Set up a client properly:

1. Go to **Clients → + Add Client**
2. Enter their full information:
   - Name, email, phone
   - Address
   - How they found you (referral, etc.)
3. Link them to an existing project

**Why this matters**: Client data becomes the foundation for proposals, invoices, and communication.

### Win #6: Send a Quick Update
**Time: 5 minutes**

<!-- STATUS: COMING_SOON -->
<!-- The messaging feature is not fully built yet -->

> **Coming Soon**: Direct client messaging is in development. For now, you can add communication notes to the client record.

---

## Day 4: Financial Foundation

### Win #7: Create a Simple Estimate
**Time: 15 minutes**

Build a basic estimate to learn the workflow:

1. Go to **Quotes & Estimates → + New Estimate**
2. Select a client and project
3. Add 3-5 line items with quantities and prices
4. Preview the document
5. Save as draft

**Why this matters**: Estimates flow into projects, invoices, and change orders. Understanding this workflow is critical.

### Win #8: Generate Your First Invoice
**Time: 10 minutes**

Turn work into money:

1. Open a project
2. Go to **Invoicing → Create Invoice**
3. Choose invoice type (progress, final, etc.)
4. Add line items or pull from estimate
5. Preview and save as draft

**Why this matters**: Getting paid is why you're in business. A smooth invoicing workflow reduces collection time.

---

## Day 5: Team Coordination

### Win #9: Assign a Task
**Time: 5 minutes**

Delegate work clearly:

1. Open a project
2. Go to **Tasks → + Add Task**
3. Enter:
   - Task title and description
   - Assigned team member
   - Due date
4. Save

**Why this matters**: Clear assignments prevent things from falling through cracks.

### Win #10: Review Your Dashboard
**Time: 10 minutes**

See the big picture:

1. Go to **Dashboard**
2. Review:
   - Active project count
   - Tasks due this week
   - Recent activity
   - Outstanding invoices

**Why this matters**: The dashboard becomes your morning check-in. Know what needs attention.

## Common First-Week Questions

### "Do I need to enter all my historical data?"

No. Start fresh with current and upcoming projects. Enter historical data only if you need it for:
- Ongoing client relationships (add the client)
- Reference for similar projects (add key projects)
- Active warranties (add relevant projects)

### "How do I get my team to actually use this?"

1. **Start with one team member** who's motivated
2. **Pick one workflow** (like time tracking) and make it mandatory
3. **Lead by example** - if you don't use it, they won't
4. **Celebrate wins** - share when the system catches something

### "What if I make a mistake?"

Almost everything is editable or reversible:
- Projects can be renamed, updated, or archived
- Time entries can be edited until approved
- Estimates remain drafts until sent
- Most changes create an audit trail, not destruction

### "How do I get help?"

1. **Ask June** - Click the ? icon, ask in plain language
2. **Browse docs** - Search for your topic
3. **Contact support** - We're here to help you succeed
