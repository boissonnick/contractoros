## Line Items

### Adding Items

Each line item includes:
- **Description** — What you're providing
- **Quantity** — How many/how much
- **Unit** — Each, SF, LF, hour, day, etc.
- **Unit Price** — Cost per unit
- **Total** — Auto-calculated

### Item Types

<!-- STATUS: COMING_SOON - Cost types feature -->

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Labor | Work hours or days |
| Materials | Products and supplies |
| Equipment | Tool rental, machinery |
| Subcontractor | Work performed by subs |
| Allowance | Client-selected items |
| Contingency | Buffer for unknowns |

### Grouping Items

Organize line items into sections:
- **Phase-based** — By project phase
- **Room-based** — By location
- **Trade-based** — By type of work

---

## Pricing Strategies

### Cost-Plus

- Show your costs
- Add markup percentage
- Transparent to client

### Fixed Price

- Single total amount
- Hide internal costs
- Common for standard projects

### Time & Materials

- Hourly/daily rates
- Material costs passed through
- For uncertain scope

### Hybrid

- Fixed price for some items
- T&M for others
- Best of both worlds

---

## E-Signature

<!-- STATUS: NEEDS_SCOPE - Full e-signature flow details -->

### How It Works

1. **You send** — Estimate email goes to client
2. **Client clicks** — Magic link opens estimate
3. **Client reviews** — Full estimate visible
4. **Client signs** — Signature captured
5. **Both notified** — Confirmation emails sent

### What Gets Recorded

- Client's signature (drawn or typed)
- Date and time of signing
- IP address
- Device information
- Complete audit trail

### Legal Validity

E-signatures through ContractorOS are legally binding under:
- E-SIGN Act (US federal)
- UETA (state laws)

Keep records for your protection.

→ [Send for signature](/help/estimates/send-for-signature.guide.md)

---

## Converting to Projects

When an estimate is signed:

1. Open the signed estimate
2. Click **Convert to Project**
3. Review project details
4. Confirm creation

The system creates:
- New project record
- Phases from estimate sections
- Initial scope from line items
- Client association
- Budget from estimate total

---

## Tracking Estimates

### Dashboard View

See at a glance:
- **Draft** — Need to complete and send
- **Pending** — Waiting for client
- **Viewed** — Client opened (follow up!)
- **This Week** — Recently sent

### Pipeline Value

Track your potential revenue:
- Total value of pending estimates
- Conversion rates
- Average estimate size
- Time to decision

### Follow-Up Reminders

<!-- STATUS: COMING_SOON - Automated follow-ups -->

Set reminders for:
- Estimates viewed but not signed
- Approaching expiration
- Multiple days without activity

---

## Templates

- Consistent pricing
- Faster creation
- Fewer errors
- Professional appearance

### Creating Templates

1. Create a complete estimate
2. Click **⋮ → Save as Template**
3. Name your template
4. Template available for future use

### Template Categories

Organize templates by:
- Project type (kitchen, bath, addition)
- Size (small, medium, large)
- Complexity level

→ [Manage templates](/help/estimates/templates.guide.md)

## Best Practices

### Writing Descriptions

**Good descriptions:**
- Specific and measurable
- Include key details
- Set clear expectations

**Example:**
> "Install 24 linear feet of custom white shaker upper cabinets, soft-close hinges, including all hardware and mounting."

**Not:**
> "Kitchen cabinets"

### Pricing Tips

1. **Know your costs** — Track actual costs from past projects
2. **Include everything** — Don't forget permits, cleanup, supervision
3. **Appropriate contingency** — 5-10% for known scope, more for unknowns
4. **Review before sending** — Catch errors before client sees them

### Expiration Dates

- Set realistic timeframes
- Material costs can change
- Creates urgency for decision
- Typical: 30 days

## Common Questions

### Can I edit a sent estimate?

No. Once sent, estimates are locked for legal reasons. You can:
- Cancel and create a new version
- Mark as superseded

### What if the client wants changes?

1. Mark original as superseded
2. Create new estimate with changes
3. Send new version
4. Reference the original

### Can multiple people sign?

<!-- STATUS: COMING_SOON - Multi-signer support -->

Currently, one signer per estimate. Multi-signer support is planned.

### How long are estimates kept?

Forever. All estimates are permanently stored for your records.

### Can I see when clients view estimates?

Yes. You're notified when:
- Client opens the email
- Client views the estimate
- Client starts signing process
