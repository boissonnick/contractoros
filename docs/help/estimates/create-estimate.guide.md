## Quick Start

### Step 1: Start a New Estimate

2. Click **New Estimate**
3. Choose:
   - **Blank Estimate** — Start from scratch
   - **From Template** — Use a saved template
   - **Duplicate Existing** — Copy a previous estimate

### Step 2: Select or Add Client

**New client:**
1. Click **Add New Client**
2. Enter name, email, phone

### Step 3: Add Project Details

Fill in the header information:

|-------|---------------|
| Project Name | Brief, descriptive title |
| Project Address | Where the work will happen |

| Valid Until | When this quote expires |

### Step 4: Write the Scope Description

Describe what you're proposing:

```
This estimate covers [brief description of work].

Included:
- [Major item 1]
- [Major item 2]
- [Major item 3]

Not included:
- [Exclusion 1]
- [Exclusion 2]
```

**Tip:** Be specific about what's NOT included to prevent scope creep.

### Step 5: Add Line Items

For each line item:

1. Click **Add Line Item**
2. Enter description
3. Set quantity and unit
4. Enter unit price
5. Total calculates automatically

**Example line items:**

| Description | Qty | Unit | Price | Total |

| Remove existing flooring | 500 | SF | $1.50 | $750 |
| Install LVP flooring | 500 | SF | $4.00 | $2,000 |
| Transition strips | 3 | EA | $45 | $135 |
| Move furniture (included) | 1 | LS | $0 | $0 |

### Step 6: Organize with Sections

Group related items:

1. Click **Add Section**
2. Name the section (e.g., "Demo", "Installation", "Finish Work")
3. Drag items into sections
4. Each section shows subtotal

### Step 7: Review Totals

Check the summary:
- **Subtotal** — All line items
- **Tax** — If applicable for your state/project
- **Total** — Final amount

### Step 8: Add Terms & Conditions

Include your standard terms:
- Payment schedule
- Change order policy
- Warranty information
- Start date contingencies

**Tip:** Save your terms as a default so they auto-populate.

### Step 9: Save and Preview

3. Check for errors or typos
4. Make any corrections

## Adding Line Items in Detail

### Description Best Practices

**Be specific:**

| Instead of... | Write... |
|---------------|----------|
| "Cabinets" | "36" base cabinet, white shaker style, soft-close doors" |
| "Tile work" | "Install 4x12 white subway tile, running bond pattern" |
| "Electrical" | "Install 4 new recessed LED lights on dimmer switch" |

### Choosing Units

| Unit | Use For |
|------|---------|
| EA (Each) | Individual items |
| SF (Square Foot) | Flooring, painting, roofing |
| LF (Linear Foot) | Trim, fencing, countertops |
| HR (Hour) | Hourly labor |
| DAY | Daily rates |
| LS (Lump Sum) | Fixed-price items |

### Pricing Strategies

**Show line item prices:**
- More transparent
- Client sees value breakdown
- Easier to adjust scope

**Lump sum approach:**
- Simpler for client
- Protects your margins
- Better for fixed-price work

---

## Using Templates

### Loading a Template

1. Click **New Estimate**
2. Select **From Template**
3. Choose template from list
4. Template content loads
5. Customize for this project

### What Templates Include

- Pre-set line items
- Standard descriptions
- Typical quantities (adjust as needed)
- Default pricing (update as needed)
- Terms and conditions

### Creating Your Own Templates

After creating an estimate you like:

1. Open the estimate
2. Click **⋮ → Save as Template**
3. Enter template name
4. Add category (optional)
5. Save

---

## Allowances

Use allowances for items the client will select:

**Example:** Kitchen faucet allowance

| Description | Qty | Unit | Price | Total |
|-------------|-----|------|-------|-------|
| Kitchen faucet (client to select) - Allowance | 1 | EA | $350 | $350 |

**Best practices:**
- Set realistic allowances
- Explain overage/credit process
- Document in terms section

---

## Optional Items

Include optional upgrades:

1. Add the item as a line item
2. Mark as **Optional**
3. Optional items show separately
4. Don't affect main total
5. Client can add during approval

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Vague Descriptions
- **Problem:** Client expectations don't match yours
- **Fix:** Be specific about materials, methods, scope

### Mistake 2: Forgetting Costs
- **Problem:** Lose money on the job
- **Fix:** Use a checklist: permits, dumpster, cleanup, supervision

### Mistake 3: No Expiration Date
- **Problem:** Material costs change, quote honored indefinitely
- **Fix:** Always set valid-until date (30 days typical)

### Mistake 4: Missing Exclusions
- **Problem:** Scope creep and disputes
- **Fix:** Explicitly state what's NOT included

### Mistake 5: Typos and Errors
- **Problem:** Looks unprofessional, legal issues
- **Fix:** Always preview before sending
