## Common Questions

### Do I need to clock in every day?

Yes, if you're hourly. Clock in when you arrive, clock out when you leave. This is how you get paid.

### What if I forget to clock out?

Edit your time entry as soon as you remember. If it's already been approved, contact your manager.

### Can I see other crew members' tasks?

By default, you see only your tasks. Your manager controls visibility settings.

### Does this track my location?

Location is used only when clocking in, to verify you're at the job site. Your location is not continuously tracked.

### What if the app isn't working?

1. Check internet connection
2. Try refreshing the page
3. Close and reopen the app
4. Contact your manager if problems persist

Log time manually and catch up later if needed.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Can't clock in

- Internet connection working?
- Already clocked in somewhere else?
- Correct project selected?
- Ask manager if there's a problem

### Photos won't upload

- Large file? Wait for Wi-Fi
- Try again in a few minutes
- Photos are saved locally until uploaded

### Can't see my project

- Are you assigned to it?
- Correct date/filter applied?
- Ask your manager to verify assignment

### App is slow

- Close other apps
- Connect to Wi-Fi instead of cellular
- Clear browser cache
- Try restarting your phone
