## Best Practices

### Complete Client Records

Fill in as much as possible:
- Full contact details (avoid missing calls)
- Billing address (for invoices)
- Source (understand your marketing)
- All decision-makers (who signs checks?)

### Log Everything

Every significant interaction should be logged:
- Phone calls (even quick ones)
- Site visits
- Decisions made
- Issues discussed

This protects you in disputes and builds a complete history.

### Keep It Current

- Update contact info when it changes
- Mark inactive clients appropriately
- Archive completed project clients

### Use the Portal

Clients with portal access:
- Make fewer phone calls asking for updates
- Approve change orders faster
- Pay invoices sooner
- Report higher satisfaction

---

## Common Questions

### What's the difference between client and contact?

- **Client**: The entity you're contracting with (person or company)
- **Contact**: Individual people at that client

A client can have multiple contacts (e.g., husband and wife, or multiple stakeholders at a company).

### Can I delete a client?

Clients with financial history (invoices, payments) cannot be deleted:
- They can be marked **Inactive**
- Or **Archived** (hidden but recoverable)

Clients with no transactions can be deleted.

### Can clients see each other?

No. Each client only sees their own:
- Projects
- Documents
- Invoices
- Communication

This is true even if clients are on the same project (rare but possible).

### How do I handle multiple projects for one client?

All projects for a client appear in their **Projects** tab. Financial data aggregates across all projects.
