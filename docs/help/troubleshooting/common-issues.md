# Common Issues & Solutions

Quick solutions for the most frequent problems. If you don't find your issue here, try the specific troubleshooting sections or contact support.

---

## Login & Access Issues

### "I can't log in"

**Symptoms**: Login page rejects credentials or shows error

**Try these steps**:
1. **Check email address** - Use the exact email you registered with
2. **Reset password** - Click "Forgot Password" and check email
3. **Check caps lock** - Passwords are case-sensitive
4. **Clear browser cache** - Or try incognito/private mode
5. **Check invitation** - If you never logged in, look for the invitation email

**Still stuck?** Contact your company administrator to verify your account.

---

### "I forgot my password"

1. Go to the login page
2. Click **Forgot Password**
3. Enter your email
4. Check inbox (and spam folder) for reset link
5. Click link within 1 hour (expires after that)
6. Create new password

**No email received?**
- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify you're using the correct email
- Ask admin to resend invitation

---

### "I can't access a project I should see"

**Possible causes**:
- You're not assigned to the project
- Project is archived
- Your role doesn't have access

**Solutions**:
1. Ask your manager to assign you to the project
2. Check if the project is archived (look in Archive section)
3. Verify your role has project access

---

## Time Tracking Issues

### "I forgot to clock in/out"

**Fix it yourself (if entry not yet approved)**:
1. Go to **Time Tracking**
2. Find the entry (or create new one)
3. Edit the times
4. Save

**If already approved**:
Contact your manager to unlock the entry or create an adjustment.

---

### "My time entry is missing"

**Check**:
- Correct date range selected?
- Correct project filter?
- "Show Completed" filter if it was marked complete?
- Entry was actually saved (not just started)?

**Recovery**:
Create a new entry for the missing time. Add a note explaining it's a catch-up entry.

---

### "Can't approve my own time"

This is by design. Time must be approved by someone else (PM or Owner) for accountability.

---

## Project Issues

### "I can't create a project"

**Check your role**: Only Owners and PMs can create projects. If you're an Employee, ask your PM.

---

### "I can't find a project"

**Try**:
- **Search** - Use the search bar at the top
- **Remove filters** - Clear any active filters
- **Check Archive** - Project might be archived
- **Check assignment** - You might not be assigned to it

---

### "I accidentally archived a project"

1. Go to **Projects**
2. Click **Filter → Archived**
3. Find the project
4. Click **⋮ → Unarchive**

---

## Photo & File Issues

### "Photos won't upload"

**Try**:
1. **Check file size** - Reduce image size if over 10MB
2. **Check internet** - Wait for better connection
3. **Try one at a time** - Instead of bulk upload
4. **Try different browser** - Some browsers work better
5. **Wait and retry** - Temporary server issues

**On mobile**:
- Photos are queued locally and upload when possible
- Keep app open until upload completes

---

### "Photos are taking forever to upload"

Large images take time. Tips:
- Use Wi-Fi instead of cellular
- Reduce camera resolution setting
- Upload during off-peak hours

---

### "Can't view a document"

**Try**:
- Download it first, then open
- Try a different browser
- Check if it's a supported format (PDF, common image types, Office docs)

---

## Invoice & Payment Issues

### "Invoice shows wrong amount"

Contact the PM to review and correct the invoice. If already sent to client, a corrected invoice can be issued.

---

### "Client can't pay online"

**Check**:
- Online payments are enabled for this project
- Payment processor is connected (Settings → Payments)
- Invoice has been sent (not just created)

---

### "Payment isn't showing"

Payments may take 1-2 business days to process. Check:
- Payment processor dashboard for status
- Bank statement for the charge
- Invoice status (should show "Paid" or "Partial")

---

## Client Portal Issues

### "Client didn't receive invitation"

1. Verify email address is correct
2. Check their spam folder
3. Add your domain to their safe senders
4. Resend the invitation

---

### "Client can't see their project"

**Check**:
- Portal access is enabled for this client
- Project is shared to portal (not hidden)
- Client is viewing the correct project

---

### "Client accidentally approved wrong thing"

Document the error and:
- Create a correcting change order if needed
- Update scope to reflect actual agreement
- Communicate clearly with client

---

## Mobile & App Issues

### "App is very slow"

**Try**:
1. Close and reopen the app
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check internet speed
4. Restart your phone
5. Use Wi-Fi instead of cellular

---

### "App keeps logging me out"

**Causes**:
- Browser privacy settings clearing cookies
- Shared device with multiple users
- Session timeout (normal after inactivity)

**Fix**:
- Check browser settings for cookie policies
- Enable "Remember Me" on login
- Use a dedicated browser for work

---

### "Features look different on phone vs computer"

This is normal - the mobile layout is optimized for smaller screens. Core functionality is the same.

---

## Notification Issues

### "Not receiving email notifications"

**Check**:
1. Spam/junk folder
2. Email address is correct in profile
3. Notification settings aren't set to "Off"
4. You haven't unsubscribed

**Fix**:
1. Update settings in **Profile → Notifications**
2. Add our domain to your safe senders
3. Check for unsubscribe confirmation emails

---

### "Getting too many notifications"

Adjust in **Profile → Notifications**:
- Switch from Instant to Daily Digest
- Turn off specific notification types
- Customize per project (if available)

---

## Data Issues

### "Something is missing that was there before"

**Possibilities**:
- Filtered out (check/clear filters)
- Archived (check archive)
- Deleted (may require recovery from support)
- Permission changed (check with admin)

---

### "Data looks incorrect"

First, verify:
- Are you looking at the right project/client/entry?
- Has someone else made changes?
- Are you viewing the correct date range?

Report persistent data issues to support with:
- What you expected to see
- What you actually see
- When you noticed the problem

---

## Browser Issues

### "Page won't load / shows error"

**Try in order**:
1. Refresh the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
2. Clear cache and refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Try incognito/private window
4. Try different browser
5. Check if others are having the same issue

---

### "Browser says 'not secure'"

This shouldn't happen. If you see this:
1. Check you're on the correct URL
2. Don't enter any information
3. Contact support immediately
