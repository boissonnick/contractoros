# Archive: Bug Tracking (Jan 2026)

**Archived:** 2026-02-04
**Reason:** Bug tracking moved to sprint-based system

---

## Contents

- `ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md` — Test cases for bug fixes (Jan 28)
- `REFACTORING.md` — Technical debt inventory (Jan 28)

---

## Context

These files tracked bugs and technical debt before the sprint-based tracking system was implemented. They represent a snapshot from January 28, 2026, before Sprints 49-52 (the major bug fix sprints).

**ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md:**
- Manual test cases for verifying bug fixes
- User acceptance criteria
- Edge cases and scenarios
- Pre-automated testing documentation

**REFACTORING.md:**
- Technical debt items
- Code quality improvements needed
- Refactoring opportunities
- Performance optimization todos

## Current Bug Tracking

**Active bug tracking moved to:**

1. **SPRINT_STATUS.md** — Current sprint issues and fixes
2. **REPRIORITIZED_SPRINT_PLAN.md** — Prioritized bug fixes in roadmap
3. **apps/web/e2e/** — Automated test suites (prevent regressions)
4. **docs/archive/audit/** — Historical audit reports (PLATFORM_AUDIT_ISSUES.md)

**Bug fix sprints (completed):**
- Sprint 49: Data Quality & Demo Data ✅
- Sprint 50: UI/UX Bug Fixes ✅
- Sprint 51: Navigation Bugs ✅
- Sprint 52: Reports Bugs ✅

Many issues from ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md and REFACTORING.md were resolved during these sprints.

## Why Archived

Bug tracking evolved:
- **Before:** Static markdown files with manual tracking
- **After:** Sprint-based system with rolling window
- **Now:** E2E tests prevent regressions, sprints track active issues

These files are:
- Historical reference only
- Not updated during Sprints 49-52 (despite being bug fix sprints!)
- Superseded by sprint tracking system

**Token savings:** ~8,000-10,000 per session
