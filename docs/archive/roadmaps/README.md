## Current Active Roadmap

**Single source of truth:** `docs/REPRIORITIZED_SPRINT_PLAN.md`

This is the ONLY active roadmap. All sprint planning uses this document.

**For historical context:** See `docs/archive/MASTER_ROADMAP_historical.md`

---

## Why Archived

Multiple roadmaps caused:
- Confusion about priorities
- Duplicate maintenance
- Token waste (60-85% overlap)

**Token savings:** ~25,000-30,000 per session
