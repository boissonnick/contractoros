## Overview

Combine ESLint warning cleanup (1,050 → <300) and console statement cleanup (1,041 → <50) in one mega-sprint with 4 parallel agents. If Sprint 113 (logger) was already completed, this sprint focuses on ESLint only.

## ESLint Warning Breakdown (~1,050 total)

| Rule | Count | Fix Strategy |
|------|-------|-------------|
| @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars | ~706 | Remove unused imports/vars or prefix with _ |
| react-hooks/set-state-in-effect | ~99 | Refactor to useMemo or move to event handlers |
| react-hooks/preserve-manual-memoization | ~60 | Fix memoization patterns |
| react-hooks/exhaustive-deps | ~54 | Add missing deps or add eslint-disable with comment |
| @next/next/no-img-element | ~40 | Replace `<img>` with `next/image` |
| Other rules | ~91 | Various fixes |

## Parallel Work Plan

### Batch 1: All 4 Agents in Parallel (No File Overlap)

| Agent | Task | Scope | Target |
|-------|------|-------|--------|
| Agent 1 | no-unused-vars cleanup | components/** only | 350 → 0 warnings |
| Agent 2 | no-unused-vars cleanup | app/** + lib/** | 356 → 0 warnings |
| Agent 3 | no-img-element + exhaustive-deps + set-state-in-effect + preserve-manual-memoization | All files | 253 → 0 warnings |
| Agent 4 | Create logger.ts + replace all console.* (if Sprint 113 not done) | All files | 1,041 → <50 |

**File Ownership:**
- Agent 1 owns components/** for unused-var removal
- Agent 2 owns app/** and lib/** for unused-var removal
- Agent 3 works on specific ESLint rules (orthogonal to Agent 1/2)
- Agent 4 works on console replacement only — runs AFTER Agents 1-3

### Batch 2: Verification
| Agent | Task |
|-------|------|
| Bash | npx next lint 2>&1 — verify <300 warnings |
| Bash | npx tsc --noEmit — verify TypeScript passes |
| Bash | npm test — verify all tests pass |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] ESLint warnings: 1,050 → <300
- [ ] no-unused-vars: 706 → 0
- [ ] no-img-element: 40 → 0
- [ ] Console statements: 1,041 → <50 (if not done in Sprint 113)

## Estimated Token Budget: ~220-250k (heavy refactoring sprint)
