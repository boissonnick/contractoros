**94%** of consumers expect real-time tracking on purchases

**28%** of homeowners say "schedule understanding" is their #1 challenge with contractors

**NPS 34** — Construction industry (vs. 62 for e-commerce)

**Speaker Notes:**
- "Consumers have been trained by Amazon, Uber, DoorDash"
- "They track their pizza, their health, their fitness"
- "But a 6-month, $50,000 renovation? Total mystery"
- Transition: "But here's the thing—it's not the contractor's fault..."

# SLIDE 3: THE CONTRACTOR PROBLEM

## "Meanwhile, the contractor is drowning"

│    6:30 AM  Check which crew goes where                        │
│    7:15 AM  Drive to site #1, put out fire                     │
│    9:00 AM  Text from client #2: "Any update?"                 │
│    9:45 AM  Sub calls—running late to site #3                  │
│   10:30 AM  Invoice from supplier—where's that PO?             │
│   11:00 AM  Homeowner wants to change tile selection           │
│   12:00 PM  Lunch? What's lunch?                               │
│    2:00 PM  Client #1 calls—inspector coming tomorrow          │

│    8:00 PM  Finally doing invoices at kitchen table            │

| Pain Point | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| Poor communication | **52%** of rework ($31.3B annually) |
| Payment delays | **82%** wait 30+ days (up from 49%) |
| Manual admin | **6,000 hours/year** wasted |

**Speaker Notes:**
- "I know this because I watched it happen for 6 months"
- Tell the tree/house story briefly
- "What keeps him up at night? The context switching. The chaos."
- Transition: "So we have two problems that are actually one..."

```

**The unlock:**

> Technology is no longer optional. **70%** of contractors have no tech roadmap—not because tools don't exist, but because they weren't built for a 10-person crew running 5 projects from a truck.

**Speaker Notes:**
- "This is a two-sided problem with a one-platform solution"
- "When contractors have the right tools, customers get the experience they expect"
- "And contractors who deliver that experience? They win more business."

| Differentiator | Why It Matters |
|----------------|----------------|
| ✅ No client login | Removes friction (magic links) |
| ✅ Voice commands | Can't type on a job site |
| ✅ True offline mode | Works in basements, rural sites |
| ✅ 5-minute setup | Not 5-week implementation |
| ✅ Flat pricing | Not per-user penalties |

**Speaker Notes:**
- Walk through the three core screens quickly
- Emphasize: "No client login required—that's huge for adoption"
- "Voice commands because you can't type wearing work gloves"

│   "The best contractors have decades of knowledge in their     │
│    heads. We help them capture it, share it, and apply it—     │
│    without adding work."                                       │
│                                                                │

| **Smart Suggestions** | "Similar projects needed permit extension" | Avoid costly mistakes |
| **Auto-Reports** | Generate client updates from activity | Professional communication |
| **Photo AI** | Tag, organize, detect progress | Find any photo instantly |

**Our approach:**
- AI codifies human knowledge
- Works naturally (voice, suggestions)
- Makes contractors *more capable*

**Speaker Notes:**
- "We're not trying to replace the contractor's expertise"
- "We're helping them capture and leverage it"
- "Nobody enjoys typing up reports from scratch"

- vs. Spreadsheets: Same simplicity, 10x power

**Speaker Notes:**
- "We're not competing with Procore—different buyer entirely"
- "Our competition is spreadsheets and text messages"
- "Magic link client portal is a huge differentiator"

**Path to $18M ARR requires <1% market penetration**

**Unit Economics (Target):**

**Speaker Notes:**
- "These are conservative numbers"
- "Less than 1% penetration gets us to $18M"

# DELIVERY GUIDE

## Opening Options (Pick One)

**Option A — Consumer Hook:**
> "Last month, I got 12 updates about a $15 Amazon package. Last year, during a $50,000 kitchen renovation, my contractor went dark for 3 weeks. This is the experience gap ContractorOS closes."

**Option B — Founder Story:**
> "A tree hit my house. What I expected to be a 2-month repair became 6 months. But the real discovery wasn't about my house—it was watching my contractor drown. Running 5 projects from his truck, drowning in texts, trying to remember which client was waiting on what. He didn't need another app. He needed an operating system."

**Option C — Market Opportunity:**
> "There are 814,000 contractors in America. Procore built a $5 billion business serving the top 5%. But 70% of contractors have no technology roadmap. Not because tools don't exist—because they weren't built for a 10-person crew. We are."

## Timing Guide

| Section | Slides | Time |
|---------|--------|------|
| Problem & Insight | 2-4 | 3 min |
| Solution & Demo | 5-7 | 4 min |
| Market & Competition | 8-10 | 3 min |
| Business & Traction | 11-12 | 3 min |
| Team & Ask | 13-17 | 4 min |
| Q&A | - | 13 min |

**Total: 30 minutes**

## Key Objections & Responses

**"How do you compete with Procore?"**
> "We don't. Procore sells to ENR 100 contractors doing $100M+ projects. Our customer is doing 5 kitchen renovations from their truck. Different buyer, different needs, different price point."

**"Isn't this market crowded?"**
> "There are 3,500 construction software tools. And 70% of contractors have no tech. The tools exist but aren't adopted—too expensive, too complex, too desktop-focused. We're the first field-first, voice-enabled platform for SMB."

**"What's the AI moat?"**
> "The moat isn't the AI—it's the data. Every voice log, photo, and task creates training data for construction-specific models. More importantly, the moat is workflow: once a contractor's entire operation runs on ContractorOS, switching costs are high."

**"Why will contractors adopt this?"**
> "Because the alternative is losing clients. Consumers now expect transparency. Contractors who deliver it win more business and can charge more. We're not asking them to change—we're helping them win."
