**Lead with:**
- Massive underserved SMB gap
- 70% have no tech roadmap
- Field-first, mobile-first differentiator
- Your LP network can pilot

**Handle:**

- Vertical AI with clear ROI
- Voice + vision applied practically
- Data moat from workflow
- Construction AI market: $12.1B by 2030 (31% CAGR)

**Lead with:**
- Documentation that reduces claims
- Data for underwriting
- HammerTech, CompScience comps
- Integration opportunity for new products

## Email Templates

### Template 1: Construction Tech VC

**Subject:** ContractorOS - Field-first AI for the 70% of contractors with no tech stack

Hi [Name],

I'm building ContractorOS — an AI-powered platform for the 814,000 SMB contractors who've outgrown spreadsheets but are priced out of Procore.

**The insight:** After 6 months watching my contractor struggle through a home repair, I learned what keeps him up: the endless context switching, crews spread across 5 sites, and zero tools built for running a business from a truck.

**What we've built:** Field-first platform with voice AI, offline mode, and client portals that don't require login (magic links). We're solving the two-sided problem: contractors drowning in chaos + consumers expecting Amazon-level transparency.

**Why [Fund Name]:** Your portfolio shows you understand this space. [Specific reference to their thesis or portfolio company].

Would love 20 minutes to show you what we're building.

[Name]

### Template 2: AI Investor

**Subject:** Vertical AI for construction — $10B market, 70% no tech adoption

Hi [Name],

Your thesis on [vertical AI / AI copilots / AI for work] resonated — that's exactly what we're building at ContractorOS.

**The opportunity:** Construction is the largest industry in America with the lowest technology adoption. 70% of contractors have no tech roadmap. We're applying AI practically: voice documentation, smart suggestions, auto-generated reports.

**Why AI matters here:** Contractors can't type on a job site. Our AI turns a 30-second voice note into a professional daily log. It's not about replacing humans — it's about amplifying what a 10-person crew can accomplish.

**Traction:** [Insert current status — working product, beta users, etc.]

I'd love to share our vision for AI in construction.

[Name]

### Template 3: Safety/Insurtech

**Subject:** Construction safety data platform — HammerTech / CompScience category

Hi [Name],

ContractorOS is building the workflow layer that generates safety and compliance data for construction SMBs.

**The angle:** Every photo, daily log, and safety checklist our platform captures is documentation that reduces claims and enables better risk assessment. We're not a safety point solution — we're an operating system where safety data is a byproduct of daily work.

**Market validation:** HammerTech raised $70M, CompScience raised $27.6M. The appetite for construction risk reduction technology is proven.

**For insurers:** Our data could enable usage-based policies, better underwriting, and loss prevention partnerships.

Would love to explore how this aligns with [Fund's] thesis.
