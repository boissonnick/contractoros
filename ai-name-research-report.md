## Top Recommendations

### 1. JOLENE ⭐ (Strongest Candidate)

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **AI Competition** | ✅ None found |
| **Domain (joleneai.com)** | ⚠️ Likely available - verify at registrar |
| **Southern Identity** | ✅ Iconic (Dolly Parton's famous song) |
| **Warmth Factor** | ✅ Friendly, approachable, memorable |
| **Recognizability** | ✅ Instant name recognition |

**Why Jolene Works:**
- Zero direct AI competitors in search results
- The Dolly Parton song makes it instantly recognizable
- Strong southern association without negative connotations
- Easy to spell, easy to remember
- Natural fit for a warm, helpful AI assistant persona

**Potential Concerns:**
- Song association could be a positive (iconic) or slight negative (the song's character "steals" someone's man)
- Mitigate by leaning into the helpful, friendly persona

### 2. EMMYLOU ⭐ (Strong Alternative)

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **AI Competition** | ✅ None found |
| **Domain (emmylouai.com)** | ⚠️ Likely available - verify at registrar |
| **Southern Identity** | ✅ Strong (Emmylou Harris, country legend) |
| **Warmth Factor** | ✅ Elegant, trustworthy |
| **Recognizability** | ✅ Distinctive, memorable |

**Why Emmylou Works:**

- Bonus: "Emmy" connects to Emmy Noether (legendary mathematician)—subtle tech credibility

## Backup Options (Proceed with Caution)

### 3. June ⚠️

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **AI Competition** | ⚠️ Moderate - Blockchain.com's "June AI" exists |
| **Domain (juneai.com)** | ⚠️ Possibly available |
| **Southern Identity** | ✅ Classic southern name |

**Verdict:** Viable but has competition. Blockchain.com's privacy-focused June AI could create confusion.

### 4. Dixie ⚠️

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **AI Competition** | ⚠️ Some (cybersecurity, trading tools) |
| **Domain (dixieai.com)** | ⚠️ Possibly available |
| **Southern Identity** | ✅ Extremely southern |

**Verdict:** Domain might be available, but cultural sensitivity around "Dixie" could be a brand risk. Some existing AI tools use this name.
